[{"content":" Translated by DeepSeek\nWhy Are SSL Certificates So Annoying? Back in the day, SSL certificates only needed renewal once a year. But now, it’s every three months. If you’re a paying user, ignore my rant.\nFully Automated SSL Certificate Management Thanks to Certd, we can automate SSL certificate deployment through pipelines.\nGitHub | Official Site Getting Started Certd offers multiple deployment methods with minimal learning curve.\nDocumentation Here’s how to deploy using Docker (example from the official site):\n# Create a directory mkdir certd # Navigate to the directory cd certd # Download the docker-compose.yaml file (or manually place it in the certd directory) wget https://gitee.com/certd/certd/raw/v2/docker/run/docker-compose.yaml # Modify configurations as needed: # 1. Adjust image version (optional) # 2. Set data storage path (optional) # 3. Change port numbers (optional) vi docker-compose.yaml # Optional # Start Certd docker compose up -d If you encounter a \u0026ldquo;docker compose command not found\u0026rdquo; error, install Docker Compose:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/ After deployment, check accessibility via ports 7001 and 7002.\nDefault credentials: admin/123456\nEmail Notifications Configure email notifications in the admin dashboard first.\nSkip this step if unnecessary, and proceed to create a certificate pipeline.\nCertificate Pipeline Click to create a new pipeline.\nFill in the required fields.\nRecommended Certificate Authority: Google Public CA. Let’s Encrypt may issue untrusted certificates in some cases (Check Here ).\nFor Google CA, EAB credentials are required during initial setup.\nEAB Setup Guide Once configured, certificates can be issued even without overseas servers.\nAfter setup, you’ll see this interface:\nTest the pipeline manually:\nIf successful, the certificate will be issued.\nView certificates in the dashboard:\nAutomated Deployment Rainyun Virtual Host (Discontinued) If using Rainyun Virtual Host (discontinued), manually add the certificate first:\nGo to SSL Certificate Center .\nObtain the certificate ID after manual upload. Edit the pipeline to add a task:\nSelect Custom JS Script:\nUse the following script (modified from the official example):\nconst certPem = ctx.self.cert.crt; const certKey = ctx.self.cert.key; // Upload via HTTP request const res = await ctx.http.request({ url: \u0026#34;https://api.v2.rainyun.com/product/sslcenter/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSL_ID\u0026#34;, headers: { \u0026#39;x-api-key\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;YOUR_RAINYUN_API_KEY\u0026#39; }, method: \u0026#34;put\u0026#34;, data: { cert: certPem, key: certKey } }); if (!res || res.code !== 200) { throw new Error(\u0026#34;Upload failed\u0026#34;); } ctx.logger.info(\u0026#34;Upload succeeded\u0026#34;, res.data); Replace SSL_ID and API_KEY with your credentials:\nRainyun API Key SSL Certificate ID Finally, configure the SSL port in your server:\nlisten 443 ssl http2; BT-Panel (宝塔面板) Certd offers one-click BT-Panel integration as a premium feature:\nFor free users:\nIf Certd and the web server are on the same machine, simply copy certificates locally:\nFor remote servers, upload certificates via SFTP/SCP:\nAdd SSL configuration to your site’s Nginx/Apache settings:\nssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/cert.key; ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; ssl_ciphers EECDH+CHACHA20:EECDH+CHACHA20-draft:EECDH+AES128:RSA+AES128:EECDH+AES256:RSA+AES256:EECDH+3DES:RSA+3DES:!MD5; ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m; ssl_session_timeout 10m; add_header Strict-Transport-Security \u0026#34;max-age=31536000\u0026#34;; error_page 497 https://$host$request_uri; CDN Deployment Most CDNs support free SSL uploads directly via Certd:\n","date":"2025-05-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.sakurasen.cn/p/2025050101/bg_hu_1099404f08d31d3e.png","permalink":"https://blog.sakurasen.cn/en/p/2025050101/","title":"Use Pre-made Certificates!
