## FLAGS

- [ ] **Starting now, no more gacha in Arknights**

I’m really out of gacha resources. My current box is enough to clear stages anyway. ~~Not like there’s any stage I can’t clear

- [ ] **Arknights Music Festival**

Too bad I quit _Honkai: Star Rail_, otherwise I’d go to HSR’s event too.

Also, screw HSR for designing stages just to sell new characters.

- [ ]  **Become a drawing master**

Right now, it’s _delulu_ hours!
